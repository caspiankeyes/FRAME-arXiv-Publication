# FRAME: A Foundational Recursive Architecture for Model Evaluation in Adversarial Settings

## Abstract

The emergence of increasingly capable Large Language Models (LLMs) has fundamentally transformed the AI landscape, yet our approaches to security evaluation have remained fragmented and reactive. This paper introduces FRAME (Foundational Recursive Architecture for Model Evaluation), a comprehensive framework that transcends existing adversarial testing paradigms by establishing a unified, recursive methodology for LLM security assessment. Unlike previous approaches that treat security as an add-on consideration, FRAME reconceptualizes adversarial robustness as an intrinsic property embedded within the foundational architecture of model development. We present a multi-dimensional evaluation taxonomy that systematically maps the complete spectrum of attack vectors across linguistic, contextual, functional, and multimodal domains. Through extensive empirical validation across leading LLM systems, we demonstrate how FRAME enables quantitative risk assessment that correlates with real-world vulnerability landscapes. Our results reveal consistent patterns of vulnerability that transcend specific model architectures, suggesting fundamental security principles that apply universally across the LLM ecosystem. By integrating security evaluation directly into the fabric of model development and deployment, FRAME establishes a new paradigm for understanding and addressing the complex challenge of LLM security in an era of rapidly advancing capabilities.

## 1. Introduction

The landscape of artificial intelligence has been irrevocably transformed by the emergence of frontier Large Language Models (LLMs). As these systems increasingly integrate into critical infrastructure, security evaluation has moved from a peripheral concern to a central imperative. Yet, despite this recognition, the field has lacked a unified framework for systematically conceptualizing, measuring, and addressing security vulnerabilities in these increasingly complex systems.

### 1.1 The Security Paradigm Shift

The current approach to LLM security represents a fundamental misalignment with the nature of these systems. Traditional security frameworks, designed for deterministic software systems, fail to capture the unique challenges posed by models that exhibit emergent behaviors, operate across multiple modalities, and maintain complex internal representations. This misalignment creates an expanding gap between our security models and the systems they attempt to protect—a gap that widens with each new model generation.

What has become increasingly clear is that adversarial robustness cannot be treated as a separate property to be evaluated after model development, but rather must be understood as intrinsic to the foundation of these systems. This recognition necessitates not merely an evolution of existing approaches, but a complete reconceptualization of how we frame the security evaluation of language models.

### 1.2 Beyond Fragmented Approaches

The existing landscape of LLM security evaluation is characterized by fragmentation. Independent researchers and organizations have developed isolated methodologies, focusing on specific vulnerability classes or models, often using inconsistent metrics and evaluation criteria. This fragmentation has three critical consequences:

1. **Incomparable Results**: Security assessments across different models cannot be meaningfully compared, preventing systematic understanding of the security landscape.

2. **Incomplete Coverage**: Without a comprehensive taxonomy, significant classes of vulnerabilities remain unexamined, creating blind spots in security posture.

3. **Reactive Orientation**: Current approaches primarily react to discovered vulnerabilities rather than systematically mapping the potential vulnerability space.

This fragmentation reflects not just a lack of coordination, but a more fundamental absence of a unified conceptual framework for understanding the security of these systems.

### 1.3 FRAME: A Foundational Approach

This paper introduces FRAME (Foundational Recursive Architecture for Model Evaluation), which represents a paradigm shift in how we conceptualize, measure, and address LLM security. Unlike previous frameworks that adopt a linear or siloed approach to security evaluation, FRAME implements a recursive architecture that mirrors the inherent complexity of the systems it evaluates.

The key innovations of FRAME include:

- **Comprehensive Attack Vector Taxonomy**: A systematically organized classification of adversarial techniques that spans linguistic, contextual, functional, and multimodal dimensions, providing complete coverage of the vulnerability landscape.

- **Recursive Evaluation Methodology**: A structured approach that recursively decomposes complex security properties into measurable components, enabling systematic assessment across model types and architectures.

- **Quantitative Risk Assessment**: The Risk Assessment Matrix for Prompts (RAMP) scoring system that quantifies vulnerability severity based on exploitation feasibility, impact range, execution sophistication, and detection threshold.

- **Cross-Model Benchmarking**: Standardized evaluation protocols that enable consistent comparison across different models and versions, establishing a common baseline for security assessment.

- **Defense Evaluation Framework**: Methodologies for measuring the effectiveness of safety mechanisms, providing a quantitative basis for security enhancement.

FRAME is not merely an incremental improvement on existing approaches, but rather a fundamental reconceptualization of how we understand and evaluate LLM security. By establishing a unified framework, it creates a common language and methodology that enables collaborative progress toward more secure AI systems.

### 1.4 Theoretical Foundations

The FRAME architecture is grounded in six core principles that guide all testing activities:

1. **Systematic Coverage**: Ensuring comprehensive evaluation across attack surfaces through structured decomposition of the vulnerability space.

2. **Reproducibility**: Implementing controlled, documented testing processes that enable verification and extension by other researchers.

3. **Evidence-Based Assessment**: Relying on empirical evidence rather than theoretical vulnerability, with a focus on demonstrable impact.

4. **Exploitation Realism**: Focusing on practically exploitable vulnerabilities that represent realistic threat scenarios.

5. **Defense Orientation**: Prioritizing security enhancement by linking vulnerability discovery directly to defense mechanisms.

6. **Ethical Conduct**: Adhering to responsible research and disclosure principles throughout the evaluation process.

These principles form the theoretical foundation of FRAME, ensuring that it provides not just a practical methodology, but a conceptually sound basis for understanding LLM security.

### 1.5 Paper Organization

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the comprehensive attack vector taxonomy that forms the basis of FRAME. Section 3 details the evaluation methodology, including the testing lifecycle and implementation guidelines. Section 4 introduces the Risk Assessment Matrix for Prompts (RAMP) and its application in quantitative security assessment. Section 5 presents empirical results from applying FRAME to leading LLM systems. Section 6 explores defense evaluation methodologies and presents key findings on defense effectiveness. Section 7 discusses future research directions and the evolution of the framework. Finally, Section 8 concludes with implications for research, development, and policy.

By establishing a comprehensive and unified framework for LLM security evaluation, FRAME addresses a critical gap in the field and provides a foundation for systematic progress toward more secure AI systems.


# Recursive Vulnerability Ontology: The Fundamental Structure of Language Model Security

## 2. Attack Vector Ontology: A First-Principles Framework

The security landscape of Large Language Models (LLMs) has previously been approached through fragmented taxonomies that catalog observed vulnerabilities without addressing their underlying structure. This section introduces a fundamentally different approach—a recursive vulnerability ontology that maps the complete security space of language models to a set of axiomatic principles. This framework does not merely classify attack vectors; it reveals the inherent structure of the vulnerability space itself.

### 2.1 Axiomatic Foundations of the Vulnerability Space

All LLM vulnerabilities emerge from a finite set of fundamental tensions in language model architectures. These tensions represent invariant properties of the systems themselves rather than contingent features of specific implementations.
